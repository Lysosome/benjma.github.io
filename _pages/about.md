What can music do to bring the world together?

With skills in software engineering, machine learning, academic research, team management, and music production, my goal is to promote human wellness and international relationships through cross-cultural music sharing.

I'm currently wrapping up a stint as a feature-authoring software engineer for Amazon Alexa, following my year-long study of U.S.-China music exchange as a Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing. I'm looking for my next Boston-based or remote role in the music tech or startup space, to work towards my eventual goal of founding a music tech startup.
