What can music do to bring the world together?

With skills in software engineering, machine learning, academic research, leadership, and music production, my goal is to promote international relationships through **cross-cultural music sharing**.

I built **[Pindrop](https://pindrop.cc)**, a multicultural music discovery game designed to break through attention inertia and spark curiosity in unheard music. I also built **[Chimera](https://chimera.benma.dev)**, a cross-market music recommender that does what Spotify & other major platforms don't: recommend songs from around the globe based on the musical content of what you like, not what other people listen to.

I conducted music emotion recognition research using machine learning techniques at **[USC CCMI](https://sail.usc.edu/~ccmi/)**, then joined **[Schwarzman Scholars](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/)** in 2021-22 to study U.S.-China popular music exchange at Tsinghua University in Beijing. In 2022, I joined **Amazon Alexa** as a software development engineer, working on NLU conversation flow intelligence. In 2023, I left Amazon to join music tech startup **[Rivet](https://rivet.app)** as their first full-stack software engineer, developing a fan engagement platform to guide and empower independent music artists in building their fan communities.
